Uses a loop to find a (not necessarily prime) factorization of the given number. Then use inspection to check if the factorization
contains any non-prime factors. It turns out that this does give the prime factorization and thus we can choose the largest number
to submit as our answer.

Note that the number is small enough that we can just go to wolfram alpha to produce the prime factorization for us, if we so
choose.
